The performance increase here arises from two factors. The primary improvement is faster function evaluation, which is provided by compilation of the function itself. Additionally we have a speedup provided by the removal of function calls between C and Python in quad. This method may provide a speed improvements of ~2x for trivial functions such as sine but can produce a much more noticeable improvements (10x+) for more complex functions. This feature then, is geared towards a user with numerically intensive integrations willing to write a little C to reduce computation time significantly.\n",
